                <p>
                    My name is Jordan Hennell and I'm a QUT IT student based in Brisbane, QLD. 
                    This is  where I put up all my past projects, for you to peruse. Think of it as
                    an interactive CV. I'll keep adding content here as I complete it.
                </p>                
                <p>
                    My specialty is programming and web technologies. I pride myself on writing 
                    clean code and creating user-centric systems. I'll be graduating from my
                    Bachelor of IT in a few weeks, and I hope to continue on to a Master of IT
                    next year.

                        ruban is an interactive multimedia experience that enables users to discover
                        wonders and surprises in the environment in the world around them. It offers
                        challenges grouped into <i>Escapades</i> based upon the user's geo-location. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Escapades contain 3 different question types: text, image recognition and 
                        geo-tracking. Image recognition was enabled with the use of the external API  
                        <a href="https://www.mashape.com/imagesearcher/camfind">CamFind</a>. The 
                        prototype features 3 Escapades all based at QUT Garden's Point campus, 
                        accessible via a mobile friendly web application.

                        back-end and a majority of the front-end development.

                        TripPlanner is a web application that allows people to plan holidays by 
                        adding activities from major cities in Australia. Users select the city 
                        they want to visit and then activities for that city are displayed. They 
                        can add activities to a trip for later review. If a user is an Activity 
                        Provider they can also add activities to cities.

                        design.

                        The Disaster Management web application was to bring together all disaster 
                        emergency services to assist with coordinated disaster mitigation. Users
                        of the system were able to report new incidents (eg. flood, fire, etc.), 
                        while also finding locations of existing incidents. The application also 
                        allows coordinaters to organise their personnel by deploying them to 
                        incidents.

                    <p>
                        The Servicing Our Autos project involved the creation and documentation of 
                        multiple interconnected web services. These web services implemented a 
                        business process provided to the students. This process involved customers 
                        booking their vehicle in for mechanical work. All parts of this process were
                        automated using web services (ie. getting a quote, ordering parts, booking 
                        a vehicle bay, etc.). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of the benefits software services provide were showcased in this 
                        project, such as Heterogeneity and loose coupling. All components were 
                        deployed to servers provided by QUT.

                        The Reverse Recipe iOS app allows users to search for recipes by 
                        ingredient. It makes use of the approximately 50,000 recipes available at 
                        the <i>Food Network</i> (2014) website via a web scraper that was developed 
                        as part of a previous project. The design and development process was

                        Road networks are modeled utilising Graph Theory. For a set of locations 
                        and possible road segments which have been randomly generated, the route of 
                        the shortest path from a point to all other points can be found. A 
                        Minimum-Spanning Tree can also be calculated, as well as it's shortest 
                        path. This system employs the use of <i>Dijkstra's Single Source Shortest 
                        Path</i> algorithm, <i>Kruskal's Minimum Cost Spanning Tree</i> 
                        algorithm and Breadth First Search Algorithm. The final system is a command 
                        line application that can read data in from text files.
